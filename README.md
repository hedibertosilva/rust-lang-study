The Rust Programming Language
=============================

This is a collection of projects based on the book The Rust Programming Language hosted on rust-lang.org.

My goals is to keep my progress registered.


## Notes

#### Structure

```
        std::io::Result
        ^     ^       ^
    library::method::submethod
    io::stdin()
    ^        ^
    method::associated function
```
#### Library Call

```
    `use std::io` can be optional that can be changed by:
    std::io::stdin()
    As well, we can use the word `as` to define the alias to the method.
```
#### Variables
```
    By default, all the variables are created as immutable 
    but we can change this using the work mut after let word.

    let name = 'Hediberto' // immutable
    let mut name = 'Hediberto' // mutable
```
#### References
```
    &name  // immutable reference
    &mut name // mutable reference    
```

#### Scalar Types
    * Integers
        Length  Signed  Unsigned
        8-bit   i8      u8
        16-bit  i16     u16
        32-bit  i32     u32
        64-bit  i64     u64
        128-bit i128    u128
        arch    isize   usize
        
        Number literals     Example
        Decimal             98_222
        Hex                 0xff
        Octal               0o77
        Binary              0b1111_0000
        Byte (u8 only)      b'A'
        
    * Floating-Point
        There are two primitive types for floating-point numbers.
        f32 = 32 bits -> single-precision
        f64 = 64 bits -> double-precision
        fn main() {
            let a:f32 = 2.0;
            let b:f64 = 2.2;
            let c = 2.4; // default f64
        }
        
    * Numeric Operations
        fn main() {
            // addition
            let sum = 5 + 10;
            // subtraction
            let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;
            // multiplication
            let product = 4 * 30;
            // division
            let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
            // remainder
            let remainder = 43 % 5;
        }
        
    * Booleans = 8 bits = 1 byte
        fn main() {
            let t = true;
            let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
        }
        
    * Characters = 32 bits = 4 bytes
        char literals are specified with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes.
        fn main() {
            let c = 'z';
            let z = 'â„¤';
            let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
        }
#### Compound Types

    * Tuple
        It's fixed lenght. 
        fn main() {
            let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
        }
        It's possible to destructure a tup.
        fn main() {
            let example = (1, 2, 3);
            let (x, y, z) = example;
            println!("{}", x); // 1
            println!("{}", y); // 2
            println!("{}", z); // 3
        }
        It's possible to access the values directly.
        fn main() {
            let example = (1, 2, 3);
            
            println!("{}", example.0); // 1
            println!("{}", example.1); // 2
            println!("{}", example.2); // 3
        }
        
    * Array
        All values in array must have the same type. 
        Arrays in Rust are different  from arrays in some other languages because
        arrays in Rust have a fixed lenght, like tuples.
        fn main() {
            let a[u8; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
            let first = a[0];
            let second = a[1];
        }
        Obs! dont accept negative nubmers to access the array!
        ** Generating Arrays
        fn main() {
            let _a = [0; 5]; // [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        }
